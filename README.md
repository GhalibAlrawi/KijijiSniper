# KijijiSniper
A command line application with various utilities for your Kijiji account such as reposting, saving posts locally, auto replying to "Is this still available", notifying you of new posts, and more!

# How Authentication Works
Some actions like posting or deleting an ad can only be done if you are the owner of the ad. For this reason, you will need to use the `login` command to create an authentication file (default is stored in appdata/auth.json, but you can create and use more than one). This file will be passed as an argument to commands like `repost`.

# Get Started
Download the zip file for Windows [here](https://github.com/GhalibAlrawi/KijijiSniper/releases/tag/v0.1.0), and use the help command `KijijiSniper.exe help`
